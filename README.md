# Food-Developers--FullStack
Food Developers is a full stack website where users can register themselves and view the nearby "local" shops from their hometown (irrespective of their home country). This initiative was taken by a group of students (including myself as the project lead) affiliated to the University of Rostock. Change the branch to "master" to view the code!

## Installation
